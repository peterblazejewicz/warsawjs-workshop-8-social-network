# Warsaw JS Workshop 8

## Description

A full day workshop about **ESDF** framework: @rkaw92/esdf

> ...is a framework which lets you develop Domain-Driven applications using Event Sourcing in Node.js. It aims to achieve this by providing a useful set of base prototypes and utility functions that your application logic can be built on. ESDF is heavily based on Promises/A (namely, the when.js implementation) - all asynchronous functions in the codebase return promises instead of accepting callbacks.
